### How is the version calculated?

### Stable versions

The version is calculated based on the commit messages since last released.

Rules are the following:

- A `breaking change` commit will bump the major version

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.2.10
    * feat!: first feature # => 2.0.0
    ```

- `feat` commits will bump the minor version

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.2.10
    * feat: first feature
    * feat: second feature # => 1.3.0
    ```

- `fix` commits will bump the patch version

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.2.10
    * fix: first fix
    * fix: second fix # => 1.2.11
    ```

You can mix different types of commits, the highest version will be used (`breaking change` > `feat` > `fix`).

```text
* chore: release 1.2.10
* feat: first feature
* fix: first fix # => 1.3.0
```

### Pre-release versions

Passing `--pre-release [PREFIX]` will generate a pre-release version.

Rules are the following:

- If the previous version is **stable**, then we compute the standard version bump and start a new pre-release version.

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.2.10
    * feat: first feature
    * fix: first fix # => 1.3.0-beta.1
    ```

- If the previous version is a **pre-release**, with the same suffix, then we increment the pre-release version.

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.3.0-beta.10
    * feat: first feature
    * fix: first fix # => 1.3.0-beta.11
    ```

- If the previous version is a **pre-release**, with a different suffix, then we use the same base version and start a new pre-release version.

    ```text
    * chore: release 1.3.0-alpha.10
    * feat: first feature
    * fix: first fix # => 1.3.0-beta.1
    ```

**ðŸ’¡ Tips**

EasyBuild.Changelog use the last version in the changelog file to compute the next version.

For this reason, while working on a pre-release, it is advised to work in a separate branch from the main branch. This allows you to work on the pre-release while still being able to release new versions on the main branch.

```text
* chore: release 1.2.10
| \
|  * feat!: remove `foo` API
|  * feat: add `bar` API        # => 2.0.0.beta.1
|  * fix: fix `baz` API
* fix: fix `qux` API
* chore: release 1.2.11
|  * fix: fix `qux` API         # => 2.0.0.beta.2
| /
* chore: release 2.0.0          # => 2.0.0
```

### Moving out of pre-release

If you want to move out of pre-release, you simply need to remove the `--pre-release` CLI options.

Then the next version will be released using the base version of the previous pre-release.

```text
* chore: release 1.3.0-beta.10
* feat: first feature
* fix: first fix # => 1.3.0
```

If you are not sure what will be calculated, you can use the `--dry-run` option to see the result without writing it to the changelog file.

### Overriding the version

If the computed version is not what you want, you can use the `--force-version` option to override the version to any value you want.

```bash
dotnet changelog-gen --force-version 2.0.0
```

## Monorepo support

EasyBuild.ChangelogGen supports monorepo. To do so, it use the `Tag` footer as specified in [EasyBuild.CommitParser](https://github.com/easybuild-org/EasyBuild.CommitParser).

For example, if we have the following 3 commits:

```text
----------------------------------------------
feat: add interface support

Tag: converter
----------------------------------------------
feat: add `export` support

Tag: converter
----------------------------------------------
feat: add new CLI options

Tag: cli
----------------------------------------------
```

Then I can run `dotnet changelog-gen src/converter/CHANGELOG.md --tag converter` to generate the changelog using only the commits with the `converter` tag.

```bash
dotnet changelog-gen src/converter/CHANGELOG.md --tag converter
```

## Exit codes

- `0`: Success
- `1`: Error
- `100`: Help was requested (allow other tools to detect if help was requested). This is left to the user to decide if they want to treat this as an error or not.
